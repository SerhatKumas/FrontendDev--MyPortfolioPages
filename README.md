## 🚀 Getting Started

Most of these projects can be viewed by simply opening the `index.html` files in a browser. However, for the **2026 Version**, a local development server is required due to the use of ES6 Modules and Three.js assets.

### Running the 2026 Version
1. Navigate to the `MyPortfolioPage-2026` directory.
2. Run a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server . -p 8080
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
